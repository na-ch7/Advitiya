# Talent Profile Page Project

## Description

The Talent Profile Page project is a simple web-based application designed to display talent profiles. The application allows users to view detailed profiles, including a talent's skills, experience, and contact information. The application also provides an option to log in and set up a meeting with the talent. 

This project is intended to help users view and connect with talents for potential job opportunities or collaborations.

## Features

- **Talent Profile Display:** Each talent's profile includes their photo, name, description, contact information, LinkedIn link, skill set, and experience.
- **Skill Set Tags:** Skills are displayed as tags for each talent, making it easy to assess their expertise.
- **Resume Viewing Option:** Users can view a talent's resume (currently a placeholder alert) from the profile page.
- **Meeting Setup:** Users can log in to set up a meeting with the talent.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for talents based on their expertise or name.
